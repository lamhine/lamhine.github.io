# About me
I am a population health scientist and postdoctoral research scholar in [Epidemiology and Population Health](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) and the [Center for Population Health Sciences](https://med.stanford.edu/phs.html), working with [Dr. David Rehkopf](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf) and [Dr. Tainayah Thomas](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tainayah-thomas). I am also a T32 trainee in the Stanford Medicine Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Gerontology, and Metabolism. I completed my doctoral studies in social epidemiology at the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/) where my dissertation adviser was [Dr. Amani Allen](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/amani-allen/) and I was a member of the [HEARTS research group](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/research/hearts-research-group/). 

My research focuses on monitoring chronic disease and aging in the US Multiracial (two or more race) population, conceptualizing and measuring local-level policies that contribute to systemic racism, and approaches to maximize health data equity. I also collaborate with state and local health jurisdictions in California and Hawaii in applied epidemiology and surveillance projects on topics including structural racism, adolescent health, and COVID-19. 

I have published first-author papers in [JAMA Network Open](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.49588), the [Milbank Quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12696), the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://doi.org/10.15585%2Fmmwr.mm7035e2), the [American Journal of Epidemiology](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwae095), and [Social Sciences and Medicine Population Health](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2023.101524). My work was also heavily cited in the 2025 [National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Consensus Report](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/27913/rethinking-race-and-ethnicity-in-biomedical-research) on the use of race and ethnicity in biomedical research.
