# About me
I am a social epidemiologist and postdoctoral research fellow in [Epidemiology and Population Health](https://med.stanford.edu/epidemiology-dept.html) at [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) and the [Center for Population Health Sciences](https://med.stanford.edu/phs.html), working with [Dr. David Rehkopf](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf) and [Dr. Tainayah Thomas](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tainayah-thomas). I completed my doctoral studies in epidemiology at the [UC Berkeley School of Public Health](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/) where my dissertation adviser was [Dr. Amani Allen](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/amani-allen/) and I was a member of the [HEARTS research group](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/research/hearts-research-group/). 

My research focuses on the measurement and conceptualization of cultural and systemic racism in epidemiologic studies, the health of Multiracial people in the United States, and the application of methods in social epidemiology to racial health inequities. I also collaborate with state and local health jurisdictions in California and Hawaii in applied epidemiology and surveillance projects on topics including structural racism, adolescent health, and COVID-19. My research has been published in the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://doi.org/10.15585%2Fmmwr.mm7035e2), the [American Journal of Epidemiology](https://academic.oup.com/aje/search-results?page=1&q=%22lam-hine%22&fl_SiteID=5257&SearchSourceType=1&allJournals=1), and [Social Sciences and Medicine Population Health](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2023.101524).
